        <h2>What is Blindpad?</h2>
        <p>Blindpad is an <a href="https://github.com/blindpad/blindpad">open source</a> collaborative text editor (like Google
            Docs or <a href="https://coderpad.io">CoderPad</a>) with integrated semi-anonymizing voice chat intended to help
            reduce bias in technical communication.  In particular it can be used to extend the concept of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_audition">blind auditions</a>”
            to software programming and technical design interviews.  It is inspired by economists Claudia Goldin (Harvard)
            and Cecilia Rouse (Princeton) who concluded in <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.90.4.715">their 1997 paper</a>            that the introduction of blind auditions in professional orchestras is likely responsible for about one-third
            of the 250% increase in female membership between 1970 and the mid 1990s.</p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <h3>Semi-anonymizing voice chat</h3>
        <p>Before joining a pad the app has an simple (one-time) audio calibration screen where the user is asked to read a
            few phrases.  During this process Blindpad attempts to measure the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency">fundamental frequency</a>            of the user’s voice.  With this information Blindpad can perform a slight pitch-shift to an ambiguous frequency
            in the range where many male and female voices overlap.  This can help reduce bias in an interview setting (potentially
            in both directions) although <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22080221">studies have shown</a> that
            pitch is not the only factor that human brains use to classify the gender of a speaker.</p>
        <h3>Multi-way blind</h3>
        <p>All participants in a pad are anonymized: usernames are randomly generated pseudonyms and no account sign-up is necessary.</p>
        <h3>Peer-to-peer and ephemeral</h3>
        <p>Blindpad users connect directly to each other using peer-to-peer technology (via the WebRTC API).  This makes Blindpad
            fairly inexpensive to host (and thus free to use) and guarantees no intermediary exists that needs to know a
            user’s real identity or contact information.</p>
        <h3>Reducing “stereotype threat”</h3>
        <p>The typical user flow avoids <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat">stereotype threat</a> as much
            as possible by removing the focus from the user’s identity and placing it on the workspace.  Besides the name,
            the core app doesn’t provide any indication of a special purpose beyond similar text editors.</p>
        <h3>No special configuration</h3>
        <p>Applicant Tracking Systems or recruiting coordinators need only decide on a URL to share with with all parties before
            an interview.</p>
        <h2>How can I use Blindpad?</h2>
        <p>A public version of Blindpad is hosted at <a href="https://blindpad.github.io">blindpad.github.io</a>.  Blindpad
            can be hosted on your own servers quite easily: you only need to serve the static content and host a small (~100
            line) NodeJS signaler (used for peer discovery).</p>
        <h2>What’s the long-term goal of the project?</h2>
        <p>The overarching goal of the project is to build a community capable of producing, hosting, and maintaining excellent
            free tooling that reduces bias in evaluation and communication.  This is a really hard problem and while a perfect
            solution might not be possible incremental progress is straightforward.</p>
        <p>An important next step would be to produce (or lobby for) anonymizing plugins for popular Applicant Tracking Systems
            (like <a href="https://www.greenhouse.io/">Greenhouse</a>, <a href="http://www.lever.co/">Lever</a>, <a href="http://www.jobvite.com/">Jobvite</a>,
            and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/taleo/enterprise/overview/index.html">Taleo</a>).
             With sufficient resources we could also start to produce an open-source ATS designed from the ground up to anonymize
            certain steps of the hiring process.</p>
        <h2>How can I contribute to the project?</h2>
        <p>If you’d like to support the project financially you can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=VW2QSSP76L36N">click here</a>            to donate. Donations will be used to upgrade the public hosted version of Blindpad and to fund ongoing development.</p>
        <p>If you’re inclined to contribute creatively (with code or design help) feel free to check out the repository, read
            over the project’s roadmap, and/or submit a pull request.</p>
        <p>Lastly: if you have any ideas or feature requests on how to make the app more successful feel free to <a href="https://github.com/blindpad/blindpad/issues/new">open an issue</a>            on Github.</p>
        <h2>What should I do if I have a problem or run into a bug?</h2>
        <p>For all problems please <a href="https://github.com/blindpad/blindpad/issues/new">open an issue</a> on Github. If
            possible please try to include simple steps to reproduce the problem.</p>
